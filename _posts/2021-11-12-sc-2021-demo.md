We have prepared a demo environment where you can experience LC4RI for [SC21](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/).
Please try it out!

----

# Jupyter Notebook for *Literate Computing for Reproducible Infrastructure*

In this demo environment, you can use the Jupyter interface to analyze logs as an example of operational tasks and use various extensions that our team is developing to practice LC4RI.

# Usage

The [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) service allows you to try this environment even if you do not have a suitable computing environment.
Click the button below to launch the demo environment.

You can freely create and edit notebooks in this environment, but **any changes made to the notebooks will not be saved**. This environment is deployed on top of the [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) service, and will be automatically deleted after a certain amount of time. Please note that you will lose the Notebook and other information you have edited.
